# Chicken Stuffed Poblanos

## Ingredients

* 6-8 medium poblano peppers
* 1 large, white onion, chopped
* 2-3 plum tomatoes, diced
* 1 lb ground chicken or turkey
* 1/2-1 lb ground chorizo
* Shredded cheese

## Cooking Instructions

### Prep Chiles

1. Turn oven on broil.
2. Place chiles on a broiler pan and roast, turning with tongs, until the skins are blistered (but not blackened). 4-6 minutes.
3. Transfer chiles from pan to a plastic bag.
4. Close the bag and allow the chiles to steam.

### Prep Filling

1. Brown the ground meat in a medium skillet.
2. Once the meat is mostly browned, add the onion and cook it with the meat until translucent. About 4 minutes.
3. Add tomatos and cook, stirring, until softened. About 4 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and let it cool down a bit if you wish.
5. Add cheese just before stuffing (next section).

### Stuff and Bake

1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Cut a slit down the length of each chile and remove the seeds.
3. Wrinse out the inside of the chiles.
4. Stuff the filling in through the slit.
5. Bake chiles in a deep baking dish covered with foil for about 30 minutes.

## Notes

This is a really tasty and fairly low effort meal. You can also use bell peppers or any other poblano-sized pepper if you can't get poblanos.
