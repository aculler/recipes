# Red Velvet Cake with Strawberries

## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 cups cake flour, sifted
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp dutch processed cocoa powder
* 1/2 cup butter, room temperature
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 1/4 cups buttermilk
* 2 oz red food coloring
* 1 tsp white vinegar
* 1 heaping tsp baking soda
* 3 cups strawberries, sliced

## Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat the over to 350F. Coat 2 round cake pans with cooking spray.
2. Sift together the cake flour, salt, and cocoa.
3. In the mixer bowl, beat the butter until soft and creamy.
4. Add the sugar and continue beating until everything is combined and fluffy.
5. Add the eggs one at a time and mix until each is well combined into the batter.
6. Add the vanilla and mix well to combine, scraping down the sides if necessary.
7. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and food coloring, completely dissolving the dye into the buttermilk.
8. Alternate between adding flour and buttermilk to the batter in three parts, starting and ending with flour. Keep mixing the entire time and scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure that all of the butter and flour are mixed into the red batter.
9. In a small bowl, add the vinegar and then add the baking soda. Mix with a spoon to combine. It will fizz up and you should immediately add it to the batter, folding it in with a spatula until well combined.
10. Pour the batter evenly into the cake pans.
11. Bake for 20-25 minutes. Let cakes cool completely before frosting.

## Notes

I generally make vanilla cream cheese frosting with pink food coloring for this. I then frost the cake and put the strawberries between the layers and on the top.
